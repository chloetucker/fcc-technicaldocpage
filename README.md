# fcc-technicaldocpage
This is a Free Code Camp (FCC) related project in the web design module. The goal of this project was to create a technical documentation page.

My fictional technical documentation website is called Tek-Dox, a place for "documentation for the faint of heart."

## Project Description
This project involved three tasks; I attempted to keep this process as limited in scope as possible.
1. User story analysis. Based on the acceptance criteria established by freeCodeCamp, I analyzed the user stories and decided to build something exactly to spec and not much more. 
2. Design. I created a design board for this project, that I would attempt to accomplish in the limited time and scope I had set for myself. Only a portion of this was achieved, but there is a lot more room for this site to grow.
3. Build the thing.

## Ideas to Improve
- Bring the design vision to fruition
- Extend the top part of the nav all the way across the screen
- Create an index footer at the bottom
- Create a Home button, to communicate that this technical documentation page could placed within an existing website
